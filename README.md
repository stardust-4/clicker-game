### **_Description_**

##### This is my clicker game project. My goal is to create an idler/clicker type of game that allows for a relaxing gameplay that can be done while multitasking. The goal is to attain the GOLDEN COOKIE

---

### **_Technologies Used_**

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

---

### **_Getting Started_**

## To get started on creating this game, touch a js, and css file. Also open a HTML file and BANG!!!
##### Link your files in the header, don't forget to defer JS.
##### Create backgrounds for your html tags in order to see them on the screen.
##### Creeate variables for HTML elements in Javascript 
##### Add JS event listener for clicker
##### Enable a counter in your HTML page that tells how many "cookies" you have
##### Create second html page displaying the "shop" and add event listener for upgrades
##### add a theme and style using css
##### find a collor pallete

### **_Inspiration_**

##### Original Cookie Clicker allowed you to create new types of cookies which produced more cookies
